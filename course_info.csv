Setting the scene: open initiatives in research and scholarship,NA,Laura Fortunato,"I will briefly outline some issues that arise in discussions of open initiatives in the context of research and scholarship, including for example definitions of reproducibility and how they apply across fields. I will then introduce Reproducible Research Oxford and the UK Reproducibility Network as examples of researcher-led projects that aim to contribute practical solutions.",yellow-background
Research Ethics & Research Integrity: two duties for researchers,NA,Tamarinde Haven,"What is the influence of the academic research climate on research integrity? How is this research climate perceived across academic ranks and disciplinary fields? Is it a climate wherein researchers perceive high publication pressure? Do publication pressure and the research climate play a role in explaining research misbehavior? And what is a responsible research climate? In this talk, I will review how cases of research misconduct fuelled a new field that investigates how common research misbehaviors are, and that tries to identify the factors that might spark research misbehavior. Initially, studies in this area mainly focused on research misconduct, in which there is generally an intent to deceive (fabrication, falsification, plagiarism). However, over time the focus broadened to the more frequent questionable research practices (QRPs). Accumulating empirical evidence has indicated QRPs are more prevalent than formal research misconduct. I then zoom in on the factors that have been associated with research integrity. In particular, I explain the role that the research climate plays in fostering or undermining research integrity and conclude with how our focus group of participants would shape a responsible research climate.",yellow-background
How to make your research credible: signposting workshops,NA,Malika Ihle,"I will provide an overview of open research practices and will introduce the workshops of this summer school. I will do this by arguing that to make one’s research the most credible and the most likely to replicate, one can engage with preregistration, to increase the reliability of the research, and with a finite set of computing tools, to increase the reproducibility of their workflow.",yellow-background
Introduction to R - Berlin,NA,Ulf Toelch,In this workshop I will cover the basics of R and also cover a popular IDE RStudio. This workshop will help you get started and I will show you some learning resources and the wonders of Markdown.,orange-background
Introduction to R - Oxford,NA,"Adam Kenny, Matt jaquiery, Olly Robertson","In this workshop, we will use material based on Software Carpentry lessons to introduce you to the basic syntax of the programming language R, using the RStudio interface. The goal is to to get to grips with best practices for using R for data analysis, such as writing modular code. It is primarily aimed at novice programmers. Note that we will focus on teaching the fundamentals of R --- we will not teach statistical analyses using R.",orange-background
Introduction to Python - Oxford,NA,"Thibault Lestang, Laurence Brown","Computer code is often generated during the research process, from explaining concepts, to running machinery and generating data, to analysis. Open scholarship involves valuing and sharing these research outputs in the same fashion as data or hypotheses, to obtain their full value. Python is a popular open-source language, with a wide range of uses. It benefits from being easily readable by humans and freely available across many devices. For these reasons it is a good tool for research and learning.
In the workshop we will cover installing and starting Python, along with basic variables and types of data. We will also introduce basic functions and how to expand your capabilities by importing other libraries. We will allow time for discussion of further learning resources and examples.",orange-background
Introduction to Python - Berlin,NA,Dirk Ostwald,"Computer code is often generated during the research process, from explaining concepts, to running machinery and generating data, to analysis. Open scholarship involves valuing and sharing these research outputs in the same fashion as data or hypotheses, to obtain their full value. Python is a popular open-source language, with a wide range of uses. It benefits from being easily readable by humans and freely available across many devices. For these reasons it is a good tool for research and extremely useful for documenting data analyses in a reproducible manner.
In this workshop, I will introduce Python in an hands-on format with the overarching goal of running and documenting a basic statistical analysis (ANOVA) on an experimental data set. No previous programming experience is required, but an open mindedness for acquiring new skills and an interest in data analysis are helpful.",orange-background
Reproducible workflows in R - Berlin,NA,Ulf Toelch,"In this workshop, we will learn how to make the raw data to figure process transparent. I will introduce repositories for data and code. If time allows, we will also create our own reproducible document in several environments that encapsulate the computational processes.",yellow-background
Reproducible workflows in R - Oxford,NA,"Adam Kenny, Matt jaquiery, Olly Robertson","This workshop will be a continuation of the previous workshop, delivered by the same team. We will continue to use Software Carpentry material to introduce you to the basic syntax of R, within the RStudio interface, with the overall goal of producing a reproducible workflow: integrating data input and data analysis in a clear manner that allows collaborators, other researchers, and future you to (re)produce a project",yellow-background
Reducing waste and increasing value in experimental biomedicine,NA,Uli Dirnagl,"Recent advances in biomedical research provide innumerable opportunities to develop novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. However, only a small fraction of biomedical discoveries are successfully translated into clinical applications. Potential ‘breakthrough’ therapies, which are spectacularly successful in animal models of disease, often fail in clinical trials. This translational bottleneck imposes burdens on research and healthcare systems, as well as patients who participate in trials of novel strategies. The high attrition rate of preclinical to clinical development may directly relate to concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of biomedical research. Apparently there are substantial weaknesses in planning, conducting, analysing, and reporting this research. Low internal and external validity as well as low statistical power in particular of preclinical research appears to produce a very high rate of false positives, and inflates effect sizes unrealistically. Not surprisingly then, the majority of scientists believe that we are in the midst of a ‘reproducibility crisis’. The immense proliferation in research outputs, combined with increasing methodological complexity and the size of data sets, greatly complicates the sharing, evaluation, and synthesis of high quality evidence. At the same time, nonpublication of results leads to duplicative research and deprives medical decision-makers of the totality of evidence. But how can we overcome this crisis?
In my presentation I will present a set of behaviours, activities and research practices, some of which may be relevant to your own work and which present prime targets for improvement",orange-background
FAIR data for humans and machines,NA,Susanna Sansone,"The FAIR Principles (https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) have propelled the global debate in all disciplines about better Research Data Management (RDM), transparent and reproducible data worldwide, and in all disciplines. FAIR has de facto become a global norm for good RDM, a prerequisite for data science, since their endorsement by global and intergovernmental leaders. Funding bodies are consolidating FAIR into their funding agreements; publishers have united behind FAIR as a way to remain at the forefront of open research; and in the private sector FAIR is adopted and enshrined in policy in major biopharmas, libraries, and unions. FAIR is changing the culture of data science, but work is needed to turn the principles into reality. As an author of the FAIR Principles, and lead of an Oxford R&D group that works on improving data reuse and publication (https://datareadiness.eng.ox.ac.uk), I will use the work of several FAIR-enabling projects and activities we are part of, including Oxford-led FAIR Cookbook (https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook/content/home.html) and FAIRsharing (https://fairsharing.org), as exemplars to illustrate challenges and progresses.",orange-background
Free code and open data,NA,Rowan Wilson,"Who owns the outputs of research, and who should? Do the rights granted by intellectual property law hinder open, reproducible research or facilitate it? This talk will examine these questions, particularly where they relate to data and code, and ask how things may change as data and code become less distinct conceptually.",orange-background
Creative Commons,NA,Sarah Barkla,"The Creative Commons licences session will examine the relationship between Intellectual Property Rights, specifically copyright, and the licencing of in-copyright works before looking specifically at CC licences and which are relevant for research/papers/datasets. It will also focus on how CC licences are being used in relation to scholarly sharing and rights retention.",yellow-background
RMarkdown,NA,Ulrik Lyngs,"R Markdown makes transparent and reproducible data analysis simple and fun. In a nutshell, R Markdown lets you mix text written in markdown with chunks of executable code written in, e.g., R or Python. You can use it for interactive notebooks, and export to a large number of formats including HTML, PDF/LaTeX, Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, or even interactive websites. In this workshop, we cover the fundamentals, including the markdown syntax, code chunks and inline code, and the output formats available. We also go over citations, cross-referencing, and templating, which ultimately allow you to write academic papers entirely in R Markdown.",yellow-background
Planning writing and dissemination,NA,"Patricia Logullo, Jen de Beyer","You can share just about every step of your work through publication and dissemination. By choosing where and how you share, you can maximise openness and reproducibility. The best strategy is to plan your sharing as early in the research process as possible. By the end of this workshop, you will have identified the publication and dissemination strategies that suit you and your project.
We will cover
* Identifying your message and audience
* Sharing every part of your research to maximise openness, from protocols and methods papers to registered reports and traditional journal articles, and many others
* Barriers to reproducibility and openness, such as spin, selective reporting, paywalls, and predatory journals, and how to avoid them
* Tools to ensure reproducibility, such as reporting guidelines and Think Check Submit
* Sharing your message beyond academia",orange-background
"Preregistration: why not, how",NA,Malika Ihle,"In this workshop I will give an overview of what preregistration and registered reports are, and review what detailed information they should contain. I will then argue why to use these approaches and how they can prevent bias in empirical research. We will then collectively discuss benefits and disadvantages of embracing such practices, as well as possible fear and concerns, in a written structured academic debate on Kialo, closing by a verbal group conclusion. I will end by giving an overview of how to preregister in practice by giving a brief tutorial on the Open Science Framework.",orange-background
Keynote lecture: Research Culture - A Job for Everyone,NA,Tanita Casci,"Better research depends on making sustained improvements to our day-to-day practices. But our habits are shaped by the broader culture in which we do research: how we evaluate quality, how we support careers, how we recognise the varied contributions made to research and, most important of all, how well aligned all these values are across institutions, funders, and the wider sector. A sustainable positive culture is built by acting on a small number of levers that will help to change behaviours across the system.",yellow-background
Simple techniques for writing readable code,NA,Thibault Lestang,"In software engineering, there is a common saying that ""code is read by humans more than it is executed by computers''. Whether this is exactly true or not, one message remains: readability counts. This is even more so in research, as code is often the only available detailed description of the computational experiments of data analyses underlying your research. In this lecture we cover simple techniques to make your codes easier to read - by yourself, your colleagues or your peers reproducing your research. We start by introducing the concept of a ""code smell"", a way to identify situations where code is difficult to understand and modify. Walking through a few examples, we describe well-defined remedies you can start applying right-away, such as simplifying complex conditionals or splitting long functions.",yellow-background
Open Access,NA,Ruth Mallalieu,NA,yellow-background
What to expect from replications,NA,Ulf Toelch,"There is a growing meta research literature indicating that a surprising number of study results are not reproducible. In this lecture, I will highlight causes of non-reproducible results.
Specifically, I will discuss why non-reproducible results are actually to be expected. Drawing from psychology and biomedicine examples I will lay out when and how to replicate towards efficient and reliable research.",yellow-background
Safeguarding research integrity through the reporting of your methods and results,NA,Michael Schlussel,"In this session we will discuss why a scientific publication is an essential stage in the conduct of research, and not a plus. We will focus on how reporting your methods is determinant to allow critical appraisal and ensure research reproducibility. We will also cover the importance of reporting your study results responsibly and in an accountable way. From the study planning phase to the dissemination of its findings, we will debate about some strategies and resources for promoting research integrity through reporting.",orange-background
Research data management for FAIR data sharing,NA,"Laurence Brown, Philippe Rocca-Serra","With this workshop, we will demonstrate practical and realistic approaches to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) in a prospective manner. Since early interventions work best, incorporating FAIR practices when devising data management plans (DMP) is a sensible move, aiming to deliver FAIR data from the get go. We will cover some of the basic considerations for collecting and storing data and building this into a DMP. Of course, this is not always possible. Therefore the session will also take the students through a use case detailing how to perform a conversion to FAIR data retrospectively.",orange-background
Introduction to planning research data management,NA,Evgeny Bobrov,"Research data are a valuable resource which needs to be secured, documented, shared, archived etc. - in short, it needs to be managed. Research data management (RDM) has thus emerged in recent years as an overarching term for practices which make research data reusable in the long term for yourself and others. We will look into key concepts of RDM, the data management plan as a tool for its implementation, and reflect on our own data handling practices.",orange-background
Version control with Git,NA,"Malika Ihle, Adam Kenny, Thibault lestang, James Smith","In this facilitated self-paced tutorial, you will learn the basic concept of version control, and have a brief demonstration of how to use Git from the command line. Then you will practice version control using RStudio as one of many possible GUI interfaces that can interact with Git. You will learn how to use version control for your own workflow (Git within RStudio with backup online on GitHub) and for collaborative coding (fork, clone, pull requests on Github). The tutorials can be found at: https://malikaihle.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/ and https://malikaihle.github.io/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/. The targeted audience are complete novices regarding version control or Git, but who use R and RStudio at least occasionally.",yellow-background
Using meta-research to improve your science,NA,Tracey Weissgerber,"This talk will provide a brief overview of meta-research, or the science of science, and explain how meta-research differs from meta-analysis. We'll then explore ways that you can use meta-research to improve your science. This might include using meta-research studies to identify and fix common problems in your own research, citing meta-research studies in peer reviews, or working with an experienced meta-researcher to address a common problem in your field.",orange-background
How bias leads to entrenched errors,NA,Dorothy Bishop,"Scientific progress is derailed by two human failings: a desire for positive findings, which leads to publication bias, and a tendency to notice and remember things that agree with our current viewpoint, which affects how we cite prior literature. Either one of these alone is damaging; combined they form a toxic combination that means that many ‘established facts’ in a field are not trustworthy. I will give examples of these processes and discuss how we might overcome them.",orange-background
Global data accessibility,NA,Louise Bezuidenhout,"The Open Research landscape is continually evolving, and we are seeing the rapid addition of tools that facilitate open research, infrastructures that support it and changing practices and priorities that foreground openness. These advances are enabling researchers to have unprecedented access to research data, and to share, collaborate and re-use research outputs in novel ways. Nonetheless, Open Research remains a “work in progress” and it is important that we continually scrutinize the digital structures and practices that are emerging to ensure that they do not perpetuate marginalizations and biases within the international research community. This talk will focus on current limits of openness experienced by researchers outside of the Global North, highlighting the challenges presented by poor data infrastructures, resource-poor research environments, national/international political influence (such as geoblocking, national internet shut-downs and citizen tracking) to Open Research practices. It will also draw on the six years of experience from teaching low/middle-income country researchers on the CODATA/RDA Schools for Research Data Science to suggest ways in which inclusion and equity can be fostered in Open Research practices.",orange-background
What’s next? Facilitated group discussion,NA,Verena Heise et al.,In this interactive workshop we will explore how early career researchers can get involved not only in making their own research open and reproducible but also in spreading the message. We will give an overview of community building and training activities run by ECRs for ECRs that you can get involved with and will share some experiences. We will also discuss how you plan to integrate parts of this course into your research and the strategies you can put in place to best support yourself in reaching your goals.,orange-background

Simulations of data and data analyses in R,NA,"Malika Ihle, James Smith","In this facilitated self-paced tutorial, you will be guided through the What, Why, and How of simulations of data and data analyses. The material covers power analyses, checking false positive rate, and how simulations can help with preparing a preregistration. We will follow this tutorial: https://malikaihle.github.io/Introduction-Simulations-in-R/. The targeted audience are novices who never simulated data but who do have basic knowledge of the R syntax.",yellow-background
LaTeX,NA,Charlie Rahal,NA,orange-background
Data visualization: How to identify and fix common problems,NA,Tracey Weissgerber,"Topics may include general techniques for making your figures accessible to a broad audience, learning to identify and fix common visualization errors in small sample size studies (bar graphs of continuous data, creating flow charts to track inclusion/exclusion, color blind accessible visualizations, using semi-transparency) and creating effective image-based figures (microscopy, electron microscopy, photographs, etc.). We will not address visualizations for big data, so attendees looking for this type of information might prefer to take another course.",orange-background
