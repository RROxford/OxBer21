## Ulf Toelch

There is a growing meta research literature indicating that a surprising number of study results are not reproducible. In this lecture, I will highlight causes of non-reproducible results.

Specifically, I will discuss why non-reproducible results are actually to be expected. Drawing from psychology and biomedicine examples I will lay out when and how to replicate towards efficient and reliable research.
