## Tracey Weissgerber

This talk will provide a brief overview of meta-research, or the science of science, and explain how meta-research differs from meta-analysis. We'll then explore ways that you can use meta-research to improve your science. This might include using meta-research studies to identify and fix common problems in your own research, citing meta-research studies in peer reviews, or working with an experienced meta-researcher to address a common problem in your field.
