## Michael Maia Schlussel

In this session we will discuss why a scientific publication is an essential stage in the conduct of research, and not a plus. We will focus on how reporting your methods is determinant to allow critical appraisal and ensure research reproducibility. We will also cover the importance of reporting your study results responsibly and in an accountable way. From the study planning phase to the dissemination of its findings, we will debate about some strategies and resources for promoting research integrity through reporting.
