title: "How to make your research credible: signposting workshops"
shortname: "L3"

## Malika Ihle

I will provide an overview of open research practices and will introduce the workshops of this summer school. I will do this by arguing that to make oneâ€™s research the most credible and the most likely to replicate, one can engage with preregistration, to increase the reliability of the research, and with a finite set of computing tools, to increase the reproducibility of their workflow.
