The Creative Commons licences session will examine the relationship between Intellectual Property Rights, specifically copyright, and the licencing of in-copyright works before looking specifically at CC licences and which are relevant for research/papers/datasets.  It will also focus on how CC licences are being used in relation to scholarly sharing and rights retention.
